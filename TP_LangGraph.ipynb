    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a Python framework for building **stateful, multi-step workflows** (often called *agentic* workflows). It models your application as a **directed graph** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State** is a shared data structure that flows through the graph.\n",
    "- **Nodes** are Python functions that read from the state and return updates.\n",
    "- **Edges** define the order in which nodes execute, including conditional branching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for AI pipelines, but the concepts apply to any multi-step process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we're building\n",
    "\n",
    "A simplified **email threat classifier** inspired by a real-world spam detection system. The pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Checks email URLs against a blocklist\n",
    "2. Analyzes the email content for phishing keywords\n",
    "3. Classifies the email as `safe`, `suspicious`, or `dangerous`\n",
    "4. Generates a response message\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work in the `email_classifier/` package. Each part has `TODO` sections to fill in. Run the verification cells in this notebook to check your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**No API keys are required** -- everything uses mock data."

    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangGraph, the **state** is the single source of truth that every node can read and write to. It is defined as a Pydantic `BaseModel`. Each field in the model represents a piece of data that flows through the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a node returns `{\"threat_level\": \"dangerous\"}`, LangGraph merges that into the current state, updating only the `threat_level` field and leaving everything else untouched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **`email_classifier/state.py`**. Most fields are already declared. Fill in the **three TODO fields**:\n",
    "- `email_id` — a `str` with default `\"\"`\n",
    "- `has_attachments` — a `bool` with default `False`\n",
    "- `content_analysis` — an `Optional[dict]` with default `None`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the existing fields as examples. Then run the verification cell below."

    "---\n",
    "## Part 2 -- Function Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A **node** in LangGraph is just a regular Python function with this signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_node(state: dict) -> dict:\n",
    "    # read from state\n",
    "    value = state[\"some_key\"]\n",
    "    # do some work\n",
    "    result = process(value)\n",
    "    # return ONLY the keys you want to update\n",
    "    return {\"output_key\": result}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key rules:\n",
    "- The function receives the **full current state** as a dict.\n",
    "- It returns a dict with **only the keys it wants to update** -- not the entire state.\n",
    "- LangGraph merges the returned dict into the state automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Open **`email_classifier/nodes.py`**. Nodes 1 (`check_urls`) and 2 (`analyze_content`) are already implemented -- read them to understand the pattern. Then implement:\n",
    "- `classify_email` -- decide the threat level based on URL and content results\n",
    "- `generate_response` -- return the appropriate message string\n",
